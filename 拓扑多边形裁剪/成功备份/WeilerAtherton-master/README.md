# WeilerAtherton
Implementation of the Weiler Atherton Polygon Clipping Algorithm.  This particular implementation is designed with the intent of creating useful visual feedback.

Input should be two shapes separated by "//".  Shapes should be points separated by "/".  Points should be X and Y values separated by ",".  Points should be listed in clockwise order.

Sample input: 0,0/1,0/1,1/0,1//0,0/1,0/1,1/0,1


WORK IN PROGRESS

# Only guaranteed to work with two convex shapes.  Concave shapes can have issues right now with overlapping points/intersections.
